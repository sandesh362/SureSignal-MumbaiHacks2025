# 🌐 SureSignal — AI-Powered Misinformation Detection Agent  
### Mumbai Hacks 2025 — Project Submission  

SureSignal is an AI-driven agent designed to **detect, verify, and explain misinformation** spreading across social platforms during local or global crises.  
Our system helps people get **accurate, verified, real-time facts** from trusted sources — instantly and anywhere.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
In moments of crisis, misinformation spreads rapidly across social media platforms like X (Twitter), Reddit, and Threads.  
False claims lead to **panic, confusion, and mistrust**.  
The challenge is to build an AI agent that can:

- Scan multiple content streams  
- Detect emerging misinformation trends  
- Cross-verify claims using reliable sources  
- Provide contextual, audience-friendly explanations  

SureSignal directly targets this problem by providing *real-time fact verification and easy access to truth*.

---

## ✅ Our Solution — SureSignal  
SureSignal is built as a **multi-platform AI agent** that users can access in two ways:

### **1️⃣ Taggable AI Bot (X, Reddit, Threads)**  
Users simply **tag @SureSignalBot** under any post or comment.

The bot replies with:  
- ✔️ Verdict: True / False / Misleading / Unverified  
- ✔️ Confidence Score  
- ✔️ Verified sources (Gov portals, news APIs, fact-check DBs)  
- ✔️ Human-friendly explanation  

This makes fact-checking accessible *exactly where misinformation spreads*.

---

### **2️⃣ SureSignal Web App**  
A dedicated web portal where users can:

- 🔍 Enter text or links to verify news  
- 🖼️ Upload images/screenshots of posts  
- 📊 Get AI-generated explanations  
- 🔗 View verified sources  
- 🌍 Switch between simple or detailed explanation modes  

This works like a **ChatGPT-style interface** trained specifically for misinformation detection.

---

## 🧠 How It Works — System Architecture  
SureSignal contains five core components:

### **1. Stream Monitoring Module**  
Fetches trending crisis-related posts from social platforms.

### **2. Claim Extraction (NLP)**  
Breaks long posts into a clean, verifiable “claim”.

### **3. Evidence Retrieval Engine**  
Cross-checks claims using:  
- Government advisories (IMD, NDMA, WHO, UN, etc.)  
- Trusted news APIs  
- Fact-check databases (Snopes, AltNews, FactCheck.org)  

### **4. AI Verification Engine**  
Uses NLP + NLI models to classify claims as:  
**True / False / Misleading / Unverified**

### **5. Explainability Layer**  
Provides results in multiple modes:  
- “Explain like I’m 12”  
- Detailed technical explanation  
- Source-based breakdown
